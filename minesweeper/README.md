## Minesweeper
I saw this tutorial written by Sam Bowne for beginners. This tutorial is written in Python 2, so I rewrote it in Python 3 and added intermediate and expert levels. The custom board is still a to-do.

The tutorial uses ProcDump for memory dumping. First, we run the Minesweeper executable in a debugger. While itâ€™s still in debug mode, we dump the memory and search for the game board in the memory dump. When we find the board, we display it in the console.
